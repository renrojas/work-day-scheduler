# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


## Description
As someone who has a busy school and work schedule, my motivation for this project was to make an application that allowed a user to save events for each hour in a typical 9am-5pm day in order to manage time effectively.

This project taught me the importance of reading documentation and how much it can help your project. In this instance, I learned a lot about jQuery and using the Day.js library to work with this scheduler.

## Installation

Project as a repository on GitHub: https://github.com/renrojas/work-day-scheduler

Project deployed on GitHub Pages: https://renrojas.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

To get started with this application, simply open it up and wite out a description or title of the event in the text-box next to the time and save it by clicking on the white floppy disk icon on the right. If you would like to edit the event, simply click on the event text-box, make the edit and save the event. Once you are done you can exit the page and your calendar will still be available when you open up the application again in the same browser.

Past events will show up in grey text-box, present events will show up in a red text-box and future events will show up in a green text-box.
